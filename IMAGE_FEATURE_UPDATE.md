# Product Image Feature Update

## What's New
The Shop.app Deliveries Tracker extension now displays product thumbnails in the orders table!

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated GraphQL Query
- Added `lineItems(first: 1)` field to fetch the first product image from each order
- Retrieves both the image URL and alt text for accessibility

### 2. Enhanced Table Display
- Added new "Image" column after the order number
- Shows 60x60px product thumbnails with rounded corners
- Displays "No image" placeholder when product images aren't available

### 3. Improved Styling
- Product images are styled with:
  - 60x60px size (50x50px on mobile)
  - Rounded corners (8px radius)
  - Subtle border for definition
  - Hover effect (slight zoom) for better interactivity
  - Proper object-fit to maintain aspect ratio

## How to Use

1. **Reload the Extension**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click the refresh button on the extension

2. **View Your Orders**:
   - Navigate to shop.app
   - Click "Orders" in the navigation
   - Product images will appear in the second column of the table

## Features

- **Visual Product Recognition**: Quickly identify orders by product images
- **Responsive Design**: Images scale appropriately on mobile devices
- **Fallback Handling**: Shows a clean placeholder when images aren't available
- **Performance Optimized**: Only fetches the first product image per order

## Technical Details

The extension now fetches:
```graphql
lineItems(first: 1) {
  nodes {
    image {
      url
      altText
    }
  }
}
```

This provides the product thumbnail without significantly impacting load time.

## Troubleshooting

If images don't appear:
1. Check if the orders actually have product images in Shop.app
2. Open Developer Tools (F12) and check for any image loading errors
3. Ensure you're logged into Shop.app

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements could include:
- Click to view full-size image in a modal
- Multiple product images for orders with multiple items
- Image caching for faster subsequent loads
